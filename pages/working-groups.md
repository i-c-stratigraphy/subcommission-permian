### SPS Working Group: Neotethys, Paleotethys, and South China Correlations 
#### Purpose
To investigate the problems in the correlation of the Permian successions of the Paleotethys, Neotethys and South China, problems which are associated with bioprovinciality and taxonomy. To focus on the successions characterized by the co-occurrence of fusulinids and conodonts, as well as other fossil groups, and to investigate in detail the correlation problems. To establish (at least intrabasinal) a correlation through the application of graphic correlation.

#### Composition of the working group
The following individuals have kindly accepted to join the SPS Working Group: “Neotethys, Paleotethys, and South China correlations” chaired by L. Angiolini and Yue Wang and announced in Permophiles 49 (2007):

#### Statement
An opening statement for this Working Group was proposed by H. Kozur (2004, Permophiles 44, p. 19). In this statement, Kozur focused on the problems of correlation of conodont faunas of open sea with those from intraplatform basins in the Guadalupian and even more in the Lopingian. As examples of problematic correlations he quoted the “fossil localities” of Rupe del Passo di Burgio (Sicily), Rustaq and Wadi Wasit (Oman) and Kuh-e-Ali Bashi (NW Iran). Kozur (2004) indicated the endemism of conodonts and ammonoids as the main cause of the difficulties in correlation and suggested to use other fossil groups such as fusulinids and radiolarians, starting from the South China sections.

Despite the fact that some of these correlation problems may also be caused by different taxonomic approaches, the best way to try to find a possible solution or a plausible interpretation is starting from the base, i.e. with the rocks themselves, providing detailed description of bed-by-bed sampled stratigraphic sections and limit the use of “fossil localities” (such as Rupe del Passo di Burgio) for subsequent times, when details are more clear. When detailed logs and fossil contents are made available from (and for) the components of the Working Group, taxonomic problems may be faced by specialists of each fossil group and finally correlation may be discussed, using all the available taxa, keeping in mind the importance of brachiopods, conodonts, fusulinids and ammonoids as current and historical tools for Permian correlation. The use of graphic correlation may facilitate the correlation of selected logs both in the preliminary phase of intrabasinal study and in the last steps of wider Tethyan correlation.

The working group should start examining data from Neotethyan and Paleotethyan settings, starting from South China and moving westward to SE Pamir, Karakorum (North Pakistan), Salt Range (Pakistan), Central Afghanistan, Iran, Oman, Turkey and possibly others. 

With this goal in mind, Alda Nicora and we will soon make available to the members of the Working Group stratigraphic logs from Turkey, Oman, Iran and Karakorum with co-occurrence (even if sometimes rare and scattered) of conodonts and fusulinids as well as other fossil groups. Also, we are planning to organize some field work next year in the Alborz Mountains and at Kuh-e-Ali Bashi and we hope to be joined by other members of the Working Group.

### Kungurian Working Group 
The Kungurian Working Group is mainly working on the definition for the Kungurian Stage. It Currently works on two sections. One is at the Mechetlino section  in southern Urals, Russia and the other is at the Rockland section in the Pequop Mountains, Neveda, USA. Both sections contain the conodont evolutionary lineage from _Neostreptorgnathodus peqoupensis_ to _N. pnevi_. The current chair of the working group is Bruce Wardlaw.

### Sakmarian-base and Artinskian-base GSSP Working Group 

A section of carbonate mudstone deposits on the right bank of the Usolka River, located near the health resort Krasnousol’sky (Russia, Urals, Bashkortostan) is well known to stratigraphers from the time of the International Congress “Permian System of the World” in 1991. It served as a potential site for developing the boundary between the Carboniferous and Permian systems on the basis of conodonts and it can be used as an auxiliary section for determining this boundary.

The Usolka section is herein also proposed by us as the Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the base of the Sakmarian Stage for the International Permian Time Scale.

GSSP of the base of Sakmarian has been ratified by ICS July 21, 2018. The GSSP monument established at the Usolka section in 2019.
