## Objectives

The Subcommission’s primary objective is to define the series and stages of the Permian by means of internationally agreed GSSPs and establish a high-resolution temporal framework based on multidisciplinary (biostratigraphical, geochronologic, chemostratigraphical, magnetostratigraphical) approaches, and to provide the international forum for scientific discussion and interchange on all aspects of the Permian, but specifically on refined intercontinental and regional correlations.
