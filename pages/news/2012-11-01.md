In order to enhance correlation of the Carboniferous and Permian sequences between China and Europe and carry out a multidisciplinary study on multiple majors events during this critical transition, both Chinese and German geologists had a workshop in Nanjing between August 12-14 and a joint field excursion on the Carboniferous and Permian sequences at Baode, Shanxi, Hulustai in Inner Mongolia and the Naqing, Narao sections in Guizhou Province, South China between August 15 and September 12 under the support of the Sino-German Center for Research Promotion (SGCRP, both NSFC and DFG). A German team consisting of 9 colleagues led by Profs. Hans Kerp, Joreg Schneider, Michael Joachimski, Prof. Mark Schmitz and Dr. Vladimir Davydov of Boise State University, USA and the Late Palaeozoic Research Group including Profs. Xiangdong Wang, Jun Wang and Shuzhong Shen joined the field trip. During the field trip, various fossils, volcanic ashes mainly in the Cisuralian and magnetostratigraphical samples were systematically collected. This cooperative project will have great potential to enhance a correlation between continental and marine Carboniferous and Permian systems of both Europe and China. A joint field trip in Europe has been planned in next year.
