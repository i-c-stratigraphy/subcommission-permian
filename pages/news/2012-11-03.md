## {{ page.title }}

It is very sad to report here that we lost a distinguished scientist and a great Permian worker, Prof. Brain Glenister early this year. Brain has made great contributions to the Permian stratigraphy and the fossil group ammonoids. He was one of the former chairmen of SPS, led the Guadalupian Working Gorup and completed the three GSSPs of the Guadalupian in West Texas, USA. A detailed memorial is expected from his colleagues shortly.
