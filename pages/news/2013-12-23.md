## {{ page.title }}

We just received this sad news that Dr. Heinz Kozur passed away today. He is one of the outstanding palaeontologists that we have ever known in the Permian community. He made great contributions to the Permian-Triassic conodonts, ostracods and radiolarians.  He will be missed greatly.

We seek any information and memorable photos about Heinz Kozur to prepare a memorial for the next Permophiles.
