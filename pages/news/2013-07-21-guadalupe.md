The Guadalupian Series is composed of three stages, that is, the Roadian, Wordian and Capitanian stages in ascending order. All three GSSP sections to define the three stages are located in the Guadalupe Mts National Park. Although those three GSSPs were ratified more than 10 years ago, no official GSSP marker is available on the GSSP sections. Recently, three distinct GSSP markers were settled down on the three GSSP sections by the SPS chair Shuzhong Shen, past SPS chair Charles Henderson and the geologist Hearst Jonena of the Guadalupe Mts National Park.
