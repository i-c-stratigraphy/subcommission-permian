SPS is happy to announce the organization of a new Working Group **"Gondwana to Euramerica correlations"** chaired by Mike Stephenson.  

As a challenge for Permian science is the difficulty of correlating between Gondwana and Euramerica, in particular when important Gondwana successions are to be correlated with the standard sections, the SPS Executive therefore recommended that a Working Group be set up to. This was done with a first meeting on 17th May 2022.
