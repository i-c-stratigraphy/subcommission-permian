The Wuchiapingian-Changhsingian boundary proposal had been revised following an initial ICS Executive review (winter, 2004-05), then transmitted to ICS for final voting during February-March 2005. The voting by the Permian Subcommission was 15 “Yes” and 1 “No”.  The votes received from the International Commission on Stratigraphy were 12 “Yes” (80%). Three members officially “Abstained” (20%) or did not respond (two members).

The ICS submitted this GSSP for the base of the Changhsingian Stage of the Upper Permian Lopingian Series to the IUGS for ratification during late March. A modified form of this proposal will be published in Episodes following final ratification.
