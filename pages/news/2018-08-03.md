STRATI2013 in Lisbon and STRATI2015 in Graz were memorable. All Stratigraphy from Proterozoic to Holocene, all subdisciplines, and all your colleagues and friends. And STRATI2019 in Milan will be the biggest and best yet.  Then there are the field excursions providing opportunities to visit classic localities (e.g., Gubbio), take in beautiful scenery (Dolomites to coast of Sicily) and truly enjoy Italian foods and wines. Youâ€™ll long regret not attending.

Now the 1st circular of the 3rd International Congress on Stratigraphy has been released. The call for the submission of the Session/Workshop/Business meeting proposals is open. The deadline has been postponed to September 15th. For further information please, visit the website www.strati2019.it and download the [First Circular](https://stratigraphy.org/subcommission-permian/files/20180803090113909.pdf).
