## Artinskian Stage

The candidate for the Artinskian-base GSSP is at Dal'ny Tukas in southern Urals, Russia. A proposal for the base-Artinskian will be prepared in 2013, and some input was received. Carbon isotope and geochornologic ages of ash beds have been respectively published by Zeng et al. (2012, Gondwana Research) and Schmitz and Davydov (2012, GSA Bulletin).
