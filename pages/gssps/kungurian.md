## Kungurian Stage

The following two sections have been extensively studied recently. The conodont lineage from Nestrptorgnathodus pequopensis to N. pnevi defining the Kungurian-base GSSP has been confirmed at both sections. A proposal including these two sections will be published on Permophiles soon. A vote for this GSSP will be anticipated in 2013.
